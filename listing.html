    <h2>Pevans' Review</h2>
    <p>The famous address of Sherlock Holmes gives away what this game is about: it’s a classic deduction game with the players racing to solve some of Holmes’s cases. Players travel around London (the board), visiting the places suggested in the case notes to find the clues that will help them work out the culprit. First to return to Baker Street and identify whodunnit wins the game. And then… to the next case! (I hope you have your trusty service revolver, Watson.) 221B Baker Street has been in print for over 40 years with this latest edition coming from Gibsons. There are 75 cases in the box, so there’s plenty of replay value.</p>
